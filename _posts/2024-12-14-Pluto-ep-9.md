# Pluto ep 9

Currently watching Pluto ep 9. I love this show so much.

I'm a little bummed I haven't been to any kpop concerts since ARTMS in August, and I don't have any lined up for early 2025 yet either. I'm hoping tripleS returns in 2025. Biggest dream: NewJeans re-forms (with a better company/situation) and comes to my city.

If you're watching any Thai GL series right now, let me know on Bluesky. I also recently watched and loved The Secret of Us.
