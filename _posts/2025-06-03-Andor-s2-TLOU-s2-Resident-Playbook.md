(Yes, part of the reason I'm writing this post is to reacquaint myself with Jekyll and Markdown, since it's been a few months.) Here's a life update in rapid-fire thoughts:

1. Andor s2! I loved it. Highly recommend [this interview with Syril Karn actor Kyle Soller](https://www.tvguide.com/news/andor-kyle-soller-syril-karn-season-2-episode-8-interview/) where he talks about how he read about Germans around the time of World War II:

> "It's just countless stories of people who, by all accounts, were just quite liberal, free-thinking people, and gradually those morals were eroded, until they were informing on their friends and turning people in because they believed it was the right thing to do."

Soller also talks about how Syril is angry at himself because he feels like he should be farther in life (especially career) than he is. I relate with that.

Also in Andor s2, I really loved Bix, Kleya, Mon Mothma, and Vel.

2. TLOU s2. Isabela Merced is incredible as Dina. Young Mazino is perfect, literally perfect, as Jesse.

3. Resident Playbook. I'm on ep 9 of 12. I'm in love with Go Younjung, the actress who plays the main character. She looks like YooA and An Yujin! The main ship between her character and the chief resident is so slowburn and cute.

4. I applied to two MBA programs! I'm really hoping I'll get into my first choice -- my interview with them went way better than I expected, and I should hear back this month(!!!) about an admissions decision! I'll likely get into my backup choice, but I really want to do the program at my first choice.

5. Last month my book club -- a sci-fi and fantasy book club at a local indie bookstore -- read Piranesi, which was an absolute mind-fuck but is truly excellent and thought-provoking. This month's book is The Fifth Season by N. K. Jemisin. I don't know anything about the book other than it's highly acclaimed.

I'm also reading [Sex and Vanity by Kevin Kwan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52064314-sex-and-vanity) and [Himawari House by Harmony Becker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55780534-himawari-house).

6. I feel like I want to rewatch Neon Genesis Evangelion and Nevertheless.

Let me know what you're up to lately and thinking about lately!
