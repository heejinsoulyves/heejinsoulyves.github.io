## listening  
It's been so long since NewJeans has been active. I miss them. I still listen to all of their songs, especially Hype Boy, Attention, Ditto, OMG, and Hurt.

## studying  
I'm loving my MBA program so far! It's only been literally two days but I've made new friends and learned a lot. It's setting me up for not only future career success but just an overall feeling that I can do way more than I let myself do in the past.
