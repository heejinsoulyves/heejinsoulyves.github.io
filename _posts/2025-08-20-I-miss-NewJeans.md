### MBA acceptance!! ###

The biggest life update for me is that on June 18th, I got a phone call from an unknown number. It left a voicemail telling me it was someone in the MBA program office at my first choice school, asking me to call them back. I did and it turns out I was accepted into my first choice school!!! I'm starting my MBA program next month, and I'm so excited despite being overall nervous.

One of the things I'm nervous about is I hope my classmates are nice and accepting and not just cliquey in the typical, white American-centric, sports culture obsessed, casually materialistic and consumeristic chit-chat. I want to find my people; I would really like to make not only good acquaintances but actual friends. One of my main motivations for doing an MBA program in the first place is because I feel like I don't have enough people who can connect with me potential jobs and recommend me for those jobs. But I do want to make like-minded friends with people who care about justice, changing the culture, and significant racial and ethnic issues and solidarity.

### Perfect Days ###

Last night I watched a perfect movie: Perfect Days, the Japanese movie that won a bunch of awards in 2023 and 2024, including Best Actor at Cannes in 2023, and was nominated for Best International Film at the Oscars.

Maybe I'll write more detailed thoughts later, but: One of the main takeaways is how contentment and observation are linked. The way Hirayama is constantly observing people and nature around him is really profound in our hyper content-driven, smartphone-first daily life. I realized several hours after the movie that Hirayama doesn't own a TV or computer at home.

### The Bear season 4 ###

I finished Resident Playbook, The Bear season 4, and Squid Game season 3 in rapid succession. I really want to rewatch The Bear season 4 and ponder it more. One of my thoughts is how Marcus' constant desire to create and invent and learn -- like how he read all of Carmy's books, and went to Copenhagen to study pastries -- gives him purpose in daily life and kind of cancels out the tedium of daily life and the stress of the kitchen during dinner service.
