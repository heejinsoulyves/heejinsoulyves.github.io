The semester is quickly winding down. I finished my accounting final exam. The only thing left is my operations management final exam, which is hopefully not too hard.

I hated accounting. With every bone in my body. It just didn't click with me as very interesting -- whether financial accounting or managerial accounting -- although I understand its importance, especially with making basic business decisions, like what products and what strategies to spend money on. 

I've now been to three Atlanta Hawks games and I'm going to a fourth one in January. I really love the escapism -- just sitting in a huge arena, completely absorbed, or at least mostly absorbed in a game.

In November I saw QWER and ARTMS and both were amazing. Magenta from QWER really is that gorgeous, and she is more winsome and charismatic than you can imagine. Jinsoul is so beautiful and playful, and it feels really special seeing her enjoying performing. You can tell she really enjoys being on stage and being the focus of an audience's attention. Also, we gotta talk about how beautiful Haseul is in person!

Today I started replaying Life is Strange: True Colors because I've been watching/listening to Eric & Sarah Level Up's playthrough of it (which I've watched/listened to before). I've always loved Steph's DLC (which is gay and fun!), but I also really love Alex Chen and Gabe Chen as characters, so I'm enjoying spending time in the main game.

Lately I've been rewatching Start-Up. It's one of the shows that inspires me to be more resilient, because Suzy's character has lived a tougher and less privileged life than I have, yet she knows she's capable of achieving so much more.

What have you been watching, playing, or thinking about lately?
