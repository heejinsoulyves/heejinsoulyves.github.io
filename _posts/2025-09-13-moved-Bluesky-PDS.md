I moved my [main Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/heejinsoulyves.com) to [Kat](https://bsky.app/profile/katproto.girlonthemoon.xyz)'s server! Thank you, Kat!! I'm happy to be free from Bluesky's terrible moderation, although yes, Bluesky can still moderate the appview. But at least they can't actually suspend my account or delete my posts. Btw I highly recommend [zeppelin.social](https://zeppelin.social/) and [deer.social](https://deer.social/) as front-ends instead of the default Bluesky site.  

I ordered the [Framework Laptop 12](https://bsky.app/profile/heejinsoulyves.bsky.social/post/3lyhfei77rs24) in Bubblegum colorway! It doesn't arrive until October, but I'm so excited. I also installed Linux Mint on one of my older laptops to get more familiar with Linux, since I'll be installing a Linux distro on my Framework laptop. I've only used Ubuntu before and not a whole lot.  

I rewatched The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (wayyyy too long of a title) and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Main takeaway from Songbirds & Snakes is Rachel Zegler is truly ridiculously gorgeous and talented. I hope she gets cast in more movies soon.
