Here's some non-default, non-obvious free apps I use on my Mac that I highly recommend if you want to make life easier:  

###[Commander One](https://commander-one.com/)###

Commander One is a dual-pane file manager. Very lightweight and fast.

###[TextMate](https://macromates.com/)###

TextMate is my preferred barebones text editor, and I tried a whole bunch, including more famous options.

###[Phiewer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/phiewer-lite-image-viewer/id1226444549)###

Phiewer is a full-screen photo viewer that has a better full-screen view than Preview, and -- more importantly -- has dead-simple navigation (scrolling) through all photos in a folder, which Preview incredibly does not.

###[Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704)###

Keeps your Mac from going to sleep. It's easier than changing your system settings. Really useful for long downloads, like torrents.

###[Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/)###

A BitTorrent client that works well.

###[Brave](https://brave.com/download/)###

Works well for me at blocking ads on YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu if you have ad-supported streaming plans. Yes, even works better than just uBlock Origin on other browsers. Brave is also better than other privacy-focused extensions at blocking fingerprinting -- test it on [EFF's tester site](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/).

###[Goodnotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/) (paid but cheap and worth it!)###
My preferred iPad note-taking app; I tested it vs. Notes and a few other apps. One thing it does better than other apps is importing PowerPoint files directly -- you'd think OneNote would do that well since they're both Microsoft products, but it doesn't. I sync my Goodnotes notes via iCloud between an iPad, iPad Mini, and MacBook, all in real time and with zero issues.


###[MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/)###

MacDown is a MarkDown text editor and it's what I write these blog posts in! Really nice dual-pane view -- one with your MarkDown text and one with your live preview. It works fast and, like everything on this list, just works.
